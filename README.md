# **Aslan's GamepPad**
## **Introduction**

This is a little macropad I made, It consists of a Xiao RP2040, Four  Cherry MX Switches and 2 RGB LEDs, Its basically a little rgb keyboard that consits of only four keys that i've coded to be WASD thou that can be changed from the code, The 2 RGB LEDs circle through the color wheel in a smooth animation and to give a sense of feedback each key is assigned a color that shows up when that key is pressed. Thats it :).
